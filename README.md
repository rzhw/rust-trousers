# rust-trousers

Rust bindings for TrouSerS, an open-source TSS implementation.

## Introduction

TrouSerS is compliant with the [TCG Software Stack (TSS) 1.2](https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tcg_software_stack_tss_specification)
(with minor differences). This library attempts to wrap the lower level
functionality in a more object-oriented interface, as well as reducing the
burden of manual memory management, whilst retaining strong similarities to the
TSS interface. (For example, implementing a singular function to extend a PCR is
out of scope.)

The main `trousers` crate contains the wrapping interface, and depends on the
`trousers-sys` crate, which includes direct bindings by rust-bindgen. The
bindings were generated off TrouSerS 0.3.11.2-1, from the Ubuntu trusty/main
repositories.

Please note that this library has been developed primarily as a side project.
While I would like to achieve full coverage of TrouSerS, this effectively means
full coverage of the TSS, a monumental task to perform alone out of spare time.
The API is also not set in stone at this time, and may change drastically.
Contributions are welcome!
